# Sim Control Hub for The Sims 4

This mod for The Sims 4 allows you to take control of any sim in the game, offering unprecedented flexibility and creativity in your gameplay.

When you embark on a game in The Sims 4, your first crucial decision is selecting a Household to dive into. Behind the scenes, the game populates a list known as ‘Selectable Sims’, which determines which sims can be chosen via the portraits displayed at the bottom of the screen (referred to as the Skewer). Sim Control Hub provides the capability to augment this list by incorporating sims from other households. Achieving this involves making modifications to various aspects of the game, which is why the majority of functionalities within this mod are implemented using Python Scripts.

This mod functions exclusively during simulation time. It retrieves the previous state and configuration from a JSON file generated by the mod while the zone is running, eliminating the necessity to alter your savefile. When you exit a zone, any modifications made by the mod are automatically undone, restoring the original state. Furthermore, the mod’s service is automatically halted when you switch to a different household.

You can safely retain this mod in your mod folder, even if you don’t actively use it. It won’t introduce any delays to the pie menu or affect other aspects of the game. In fact, as long as you refrain from adding any sims to the Skewer, the game will function as if no mod were installed.
